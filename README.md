# Ray Tracing Project - PPM Image Renderer
This project generates a simple PPM (Portable Pixel Map) image. The project will be expanded on to generate images with appropriate ray-tracing. 

#### Getting Started
Clone or download the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
To build and run the project, use the make command:
```bash
make
```
This will compile the program and execute it, outputting the PPM image to the images directory. You can then view the image in 

#### Example Output
A **ppm** image is formatted like so:

```txt
P3
256 256
255
0 0 0
1 0 0
2 0 0
...
```

### To Do
[__] Expand this project into a full ray tracing engine to render more complex scenes with spheres, lighting, etc.

[__] Expand upon the ppm image to include hue/gradients etc.
